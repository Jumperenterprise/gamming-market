## Developped with Angular 🛠️
#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run build:watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.
* `npm run lint` - runs `tslint` on the project files.
* `npm run serve` - runs `lite-server`.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
* `npm run ci` - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
